An exercise using HTML5 and CSS3 to build a landing page for a fake project from BLOC.IO

Upon starting this project at the beginning of this week I noticed that I was using a newer version of the Skeleton boilerplate (created by Github user @dhg) which caused for some interesting formatting when I applied the CSS styles.
My plan ahead is to continue adding the styles and then go back and trouble shoot each section to make the project compatible with the newer version of Skeleton which was released recently.

Here it goes!
